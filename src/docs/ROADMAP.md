# PiOpenHub Roadmap

## Overview

The PiOpenHub project aims to create a decentralized application that integrates with blockchain technologies to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions and user management. This roadmap outlines our planned features and improvements for the upcoming quarters.

## Q1 2024

### Goals
- **User Authentication**: Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Basic API Endpoints**: Develop RESTful API endpoints for user management (create, read, update, delete).
- **Database Setup**: Establish a SQLite database for local development and prepare for migration to a production database.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement user registration and login endpoints.
- [ ] Create user model and database schema.
- [ ] Write unit tests for user authentication features.
- [ ] Update documentation with API usage examples.

## Q2 2024

### Goals
- **Transaction Services**: Expand the application to support cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Integrate with Pi Network APIs for transaction processing.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures, including input validation and error handling.

### Tasks
- [ ] Develop transaction model and database schema.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for transaction management.
- [ ] Integrate with blockchain services (e.g., Web3).
- [ ] Conduct security audits and implement best practices.

## Q3 2024

### Goals
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the application.
- **Community Feedback**: Launch a beta version for community testing and gather feedback.
- **Documentation Improvement**: Enhance documentation based on user feedback and testing experiences.

### Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement a web interface using a front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue).
- [ ] Conduct user testing sessions and gather feedback.
- [ ] Update documentation with user guides and FAQs.

## Q4 2024

### Goals
- **Mobile Application**: Explore the development of a mobile application for iOS and Android.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize application performance and scalability.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster community involvement through hackathons and contribution events.

### Tasks
- [ ] Research and select a framework for mobile app development (e.g., React Native).
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring tools and optimize code.
- [ ] Organize community events to encourage contributions and collaboration.

## Future Vision

- **Decentralized Identity**: Explore the implementation of decentralized identity solutions for enhanced user privacy and security.
- **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Investigate the possibility of supporting cross-chain transactions with other blockchain networks.
- **Partnerships**: Establish partnerships with other projects in the Pi Network ecosystem to enhance functionality and reach.

## Conclusion

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help shape the future of PiOpenHub. Together, we can build a robust and user-friendly application that leverages the power of blockchain technology.

Thank you for your interest in PiOpenHub!
