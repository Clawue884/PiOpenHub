## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository by forking it on GitHub.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/PiOpenHub.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Respect the Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and considerate to all contributors.
- **Follow the Project Structure**: Maintain the existing project structure when adding new features or files.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the following format:
  ```
  [Type] Short description of the change
  ```
  Types can include: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), etc.

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality, please follow these coding standards:

- **Python Style Guide**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
- **JavaScript Style Guide**: Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript code style.
- **Docstrings**: Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules. Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for formatting.
- **Type Annotations**: Use type annotations for function parameters and return types to improve code readability.

## Testing

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality. Follow these steps to run tests:

1. **Run Unit Tests**: Use the following command to run unit tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s src/main/tests -p "*.py"
   ```
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Run end-to-end tests using:
   ```bash
   python src/tests/e2e_test_user.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_transaction.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_ai.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_analytics.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_security.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_performance.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_edge.py
   python src/tests/e2e_test_quantum.py
   ```
3. **Add Tests**: When adding new features or fixing bugs, please include corresponding tests.

## Documentation

Documentation is essential for users and contributors. Please update the documentation when making changes to the codebase. Use Markdown for formatting and ensure that all new features are documented in the `README.md` or relevant documentation files.

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you encounter any issues or have feature requests, please open an issue in the GitHub repository. Provide a clear description of the problem or feature, along with any relevant details.
